# Contributing to this repository 

## Getting started

Before you begin:
- Check out the [documentation](https://tardis-sn.github.io/carsus/)
- Check out the [existing issues](https://github.com/tardis-sn/carsus/issues) having different labels to start with some already existing issues by your fellow contributors.

Before you think about your changes, check to see if an [issue exists](https://github.com/tardis-sn/carsus/issues) already for the change you want to make.

### Don't see your issue? Open one

If you spot something new, open an issue! Someone or the other would hop in to help you out! We'll use the issue to have a conversation about the problem you want to fix.

### Ready to make a change? Fork the repo

Fork using the command line:

- Fork the repository so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.

### Make your update:
Make your changes to the file(s) you'd like to update.
  - Are you making changes to the application code? 
  - Are you contributing to markdown? 

### Open a pull request
When you're done making changes and you'd like to propose them for review, open your PR (pull request).

### Submit your PR & get it reviewed
- Once you submit your PR, others from the Docs community will review it with you. The first thing you're going to want to do is a [self review](#self-review).
- After that, we may have questions, check back on your PR to keep up with the conversation.
- Did you have an issue, like a merge conflict? Check out our [git tutorial](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/managing-merge-conflicts) on how to resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

## Opening a pull request
You can use the GitHub user interface :pencil2: for some small changes, like fixing a typo or updating a readme. You can also fork the repo and then clone it locally, to view changes and run your tests on your machine.

:yellow_heart: Reviews are always respectful, acknowledging that everyone did the best possible job with the knowledge they had at the time.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews discuss content, not the person who created it.  
:yellow_heart: Reviews are constructive and start conversation around feedback.  

### Self review
You should always review your own PR first.

For content changes, make sure that you:
- [ ] Confirm that the changes address every part of the content design plan from your issue (if there are differences, explain them).
- [ ] Review the content for technical accuracy.
- [ ] Copy-edit the changes for grammar, spelling, and adherence to the style guide.
- [ ] Check new or updated Liquid statements to confirm that versioning is correct.
- [ ] Check that all of your changes render correctly in staging. Remember, that lists and tables can be tricky.
- [ ] If there are any failing checks in your PR, troubleshoot them until they're all passing.

### Suggested changes
We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using suggested changes or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.

As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as resolved.
